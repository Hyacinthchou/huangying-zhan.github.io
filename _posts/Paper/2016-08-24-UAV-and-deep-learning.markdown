__Summary__

This paper propose an integration of deep learning algorithm and UAV drone. The target is to allow a drone automatically navigating in an indoor environment & searching for a school bag.

It is a classification problem. 6 types of commands (classes) are trained with CaffeNet, including,

The dataset construction is based on human response imitation. Firstly, human control the drone in the environment using computer command which will be sent to the drone. Second, the commands are recorded as label of image seen by the drone. Third, train a DNN as classification problem.

__Key points__

* human response imitation

__Pros__: 

* Easy dataset construction
* Simple classification problem -> easy to train a DNN

__Cons__ 

* Specific drone required
* Limited command(?)

__Summary__

This paper integrates deep learning (classification) and UAV drone. The target is to allow UAV to recognize forest trail and make a corresponding move decision, including,

1. forward
2. turn left
3. turn right

The dataset construction method is innovative. A hiker put 3 cameras (GoPro) on his head and walks straghtly in forest trails. The images taken by 3 cameras corresponds to 3 different classes.

__Key points__

* 3 cameras for dataset construction

__Pros__: 

* Easy dataset construction
* Simple classification problem -> easy to train a DNN

__Cons__ 

* Limited command, because only 3 kinds of actions can be recorded
