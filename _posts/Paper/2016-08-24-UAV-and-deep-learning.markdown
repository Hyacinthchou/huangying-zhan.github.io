**Summary**

This paper proposes an integration of deep learning algorithm and UAV drone. The target is to allow a drone automatically navigating in an indoor environment & searching for a school bag.

It is a classification problem. 6 types of commands (classes) are trained with CaffeNet, including,

The dataset construction is based on human response imitation. Firstly, human control the drone in the environment using computer command which will be sent to the drone. Second, the commands are recorded as label of images seen by the drone. Third, train a DNN as classification problem.

**Key points**

* Human response imitation

**Pros**

* Easy dataset construction
* Simple classification problem -> easy to train a DNN

**Cons**

* Specific drone required
* Limited command(?)

**Summary**

This paper integrates deep learning (classification) and UAV drone. The target is to allow UAV to recognize forest trail and make a corresponding move decision, including,

1. forward
2. turn left
3. turn right

The dataset construction method is innovative. A hiker put 3 cameras (GoPro) on his head and walks straghtly in forest trails. The images taken by 3 cameras corresponds to 3 different classes.

**Key points**

* 3 cameras for dataset construction

**Pros**

* Easy dataset construction
* Simple classification problem -> easy to train a DNN

**Cons**

* Limited command, because only 3 kinds of actions can be recorded
